# Random Quote Generator

This is a simple web application built in **React.js** that gets quotes from an external website, randomly selects one of them and allows the user to share the random quote to twitter.

It looks like this:

To run locally:

1. Clone the repository. You can use the URL given in the <>Code option at the top right corner.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/arshiya-k/randomQuoteGenerator.git
```

2. Run it from the **root directory** with the command

```sh
$ npm run start
```

The terminal will display where to access the website. For example, it will display like this

```
Local:            http://localhost:3000/
On Your Network:  http://10.225.86.195:3000/
```
